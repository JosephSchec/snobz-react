## SNOBZ_React
Based on Snobz 2 Snobz React allowed me to practice useing react components 

### - visit [Snobzz](snobzz.vercel.app)

Why is version 3 better than 2?
  * Cleaner implementaion
  * Using react components / state and react-bootstrap allowing spa to run smoother
  
Things I learned creating version 3 / react:
  * How to use react-bootstrap
  * How to use react-leaflet
  * Bringing up state in functional components
  * Axios and Redux 
  * How to use .env in react
  * Bit of sass (.scss)
