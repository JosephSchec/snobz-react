## SNOBZ_React
Based on Snobz 2 Snobz React allowed me to practice useing react components 

### - visit [Snobzz](snobzz.vercel.app)

Why is version 3 better than 2?
  * Cleaner implementaion
  * Using react components / state and react-bootstrap allowing spa to run smoother
  * Smoother transition of modals and off-canvases
  * Created with react router 

Technologies(/things) I learned / used when creating snobz-react:
  *  react-bootstrap
  *  react-leaflet
  *  Bringing up state within functional components
  *  Axios - fetch async in redux
  *  Redux 
  *  How to use .env in react
  *  Bit of sass (.scss) and manipulating bootstrap defaults
